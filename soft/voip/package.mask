# This is *very* new and will require an extensive rewrite of your
# configuration before it will work. If you are not ready to dedicate
# at least a day towards testing and another day towards configuring
# you simply do not want this yet. If you do have this amount of time
# on your hands please join #gentoo-voip and help us document the
# migration path. Thank you.
