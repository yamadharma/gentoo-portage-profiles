# Mask the Qt4 meta ebuild, to prevent devs from being silly and depend on
# the meta ebuild instead of on the specific split Qt ebuilds needed. See
# bug 217161 comment 11. Users may unmask this if they want to pull in all
# Qt modules, but packages in portage (or overlays) will pull in the split
# modules they need as dependency. Unmasking this will most likely pull in
# more than you need. This meta ebuild will be removed when we can add sets
# to the portage tree.
